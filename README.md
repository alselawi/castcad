A set of simple tools for dentists to work with their intra-oral scans.

### Motivation

Intra-oral scanners are becoming more and more popular. Each brand has its own software, and each software has its own tools, some of which are pretty advanced, but most of them only offer the basic scanning exporting.

The goal of this project is to provide dentist with a consistent set of tools that can be used with any scanner.
